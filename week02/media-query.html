            <h2>3 Nephi 3:2</h2>
            <p>Lachoneus, most noble and chief governor of the land, behold, I write this epistle unto you, and do give
                unto you exceedingly great praise because of your firmness, and also the firmness of your people, in
                maintaining that which ye suppose to be your right and liberty; yea, ye do stand well, as if ye were
                supported by the hand of a god, in the defence of your liberty, and your property, and your country, or
                that which ye do call so.</p>

            <h2>Alma 33:11</h2>
            <p>And thou didst hear me because of mine afflictions and my sincerity; and it is because of thy Son that
                thou hast been thus merciful unto me, therefore I will cry unto thee in all mine afflictions, for in
                thee is my joy; for thou hast turned thy judgments away from me, because of thy Son.</p>
